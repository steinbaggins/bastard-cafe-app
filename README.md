# Bastard Cafe App

**_\*This is an unofficial Bastard Café app._**

Bastard Cafe App is a tool to search the massive boardgame collection of [Bastard Café](https://bastardcafe.dk/).
Here are some key improvements over the official app:
  - Support high resolution screens.
  - Faster response times - powered by [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).
  - Pre-defined game filters.
  - A more modern design.

### Expo share link
Will be here in a near future.

### Motivation
I'm a frequent user of Bastard Café which made me wanna do this project.
Beside that I do React/React Native at work so you could say this is a playground.
